# This file defines your applicationâ€™s models
# When changing the data model you need to run the following commands:
# `prisma deploy` - This updates the API with the new model
# `prisma generate` - This generates a new JS file that exposes the CRUD methods for the newly added model
# NOTE: `prisma generate` has bee added as a hook in prisma.yml and no longer needs to be invoked to update the model.
